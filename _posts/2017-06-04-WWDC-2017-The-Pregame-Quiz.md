If you'd like a quick primer on how this all works or how it got started, check out the first two quizzes from [2015][1] and [2016][2]. This year, in lieu of technical questions, I've created all random, general knowledge questions about W.W.D.C., iOS and Apple in general.

Participants — hop onto your dispatch_queue_create(@"QUIZ_TIME!")⚡️
