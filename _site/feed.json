I’m talking about the “Oh Yeahs” and the “We also did this” API changes that weren’t deemed worthy enough of a call out during the keynote or state of the union address. Thus, such changes will find themselves relegated to its own cozy corner within the word cloud slide.</p>\n\n<p>However, I find that I have quite a predilection for such API changes. The ones that might not make the press or be the chatter among devs undoubtedly taking over each coffee shop in San Jose are the ones which are often extremely valuable to our work. They just aren’t as “sexy”, as such, the spotlight eludes them.</p>\n\n<p>This week, let’s chat about one such enhancement that’s been around since iOS 6, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSSecureCoding</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"archiving-and-serialization\">Archiving and Serialization</h3>\n<p>Every iOS app will eventually be a consumer, or producer, of some sort of data. This data can represent itself in several different ways, each of which requires its own nuanced approach in terms of security and how its used:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Raw Data:</strong> The actual stream of bites representing information.</li>\n  <li><strong>Primitive Data:</strong> A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#UTF\" target=\"_blank\">UTF</a> representation of primitive data. On iOS, this typically ends up as JSON.</li>\n  <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> This is how you’ve chosen to model your data in a strongly typed way. Think of taking some primitive data, and injecting it into a model.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At each point in the life cycle of some data, there are different ways in which developers must handle it. For example, if you are expecting a tiny text file to be returned from your server - you might be tipped off that something is dreadfully wrong if the file is ten gigs when its still in a primitive state:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">struct</span> <span class=\"kt\">DataChecks</span> \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">static</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">maxTextSize</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">1048576</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">textData</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">someTextFile</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">guard</span> <span class=\"n\">textData</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">length</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span> <span class=\"kt\">DataChecks</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">maxTextSize</span> <span class=\"k\">else</span> \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// Funny business</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Conversely, one would also be aware of some tomfoolery afoot if deserializing that data to JSON brought about a much different result:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">data</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSData</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">parsedJSON</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">Any</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">do</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">option</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">JSONSerialization</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">ReadingOptions</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">rawValue</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n    <span class=\"c1\">// If this works, we know the data will be strings/arrays/etc.</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// Things like XML, for example, would fail here.</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">parsedJSON</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">try</span> <span class=\"kt\">JSONSerialization</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">jsonObject</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">with</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">data</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"kt\">Data</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">options</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">option</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span> <span class=\"k\">catch</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"cm\">/* Dragons.here */</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Whether its by using a some type of checksum on a raw data blob or ensuring primitive data becomes what you expect it to, as a programmer you’re actively taking steps to make sure that the data you’re playing with, plays nice.</p>\n\n<p>Then, down the road, the data eventually needs to make its way on disk.

Foundation would rather not have that happen, but it also could use your help to ensure that it doesn’t.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"understanding-the-unarchiving-pipeline\">Understanding the Unarchiving Pipeline</h3>\n<p>To get a feel for how things could go wrong here, it’s key to understand what exactly <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSKeyedUnarchiver</code> is doing when it unarchives your structured data. When your data is stored, it’ll look a little something like this in the archive:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-json highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"s2\">\"$class\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"Post\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\">\n    </span><span class=\"s2\">\"title\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s2\">\"...\"</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"w\">\n</span></code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Later on, when one goes to pull it back out via unarchiving, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSKeyedUnarchiver</code> will dynamically look for a class with the same name of the key (passed in via its initializer) in your app’s bundle. Then, a few things happen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>An instance of that class gets allocated in memory</li>\n  <li>Then, it’s initialized to allow it to decode</li>\n  <li>Lastly, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">awakeAfter(using:)</code> gets invoked to allow for any final state considerations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That all looks reasonable, but consider this - the unarchiver will do this on <em>whatever</em> key you pass. So if a #TerribleHumanBeing injected some nonsense in there, this is what happens:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">unarchiver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">decodeObject</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">forKey</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSKeyedArchiverRootObjectKey</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">BadTerribleThings</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">alloc</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">BadTerribleThings</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">init</span><span class=\"p\">?(</span><span class=\"nv\">coder</span><span class=\"p\">:)</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">BadTerribleThings</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">awakeAfer</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">using</span><span class=\"p\">:)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>😱.</p>\n\n<p>Under the hood, when we invoked <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">unarchiveTopLevelObject(with:)</code> an instance of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">KSKeyedUnarchiver</code> popped up and tried to decode an object for the given key. Now, you can see why this line really matters:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">guard</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">postBlob</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">try</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSKeyedUnarchiver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">unarchiveTopLevelObject</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">with</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">postData</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>…because even though we’ll fail since the downcast will not pass, and even though we’ll discard the object - the archiver still could’ve just allocated some BS.</p>\n\n<p>And said BS could do a few different things to really flip your biscuits.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps it might change some global state 💀!<br />\nOr initialize some sort of singleton 🙅🏻‍♂️!<br />\n…or perform any other attack vector that they can dream up ⚰️.<br /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You might think that’s dramatic, but archives can be maliciously constructed. Plus, if <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1123741346425180161?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Troughton-Smith</a> can make Marzipan work when Marzipan isn’t released on apps that he doesn’t have the source code too - trust no one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So what’s a dev to do? Of course, the answer is to use <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSSecureCoding</code> - and even better, it’s typically <em>a one line change</em>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"secure-serialization\">Secure Serialization</h3>\n<p>The <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSSecureCoding</code> protocol directly inherits from <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSCoding</code> - and as the name implies it performs the same functions as its parent but in a more secure fashion. Using it, we’ll avoid any arbitrary code execution attacks as mentioned above.</p>\n\n<p>Normally, I’d dive into the intricacies of the API - but this one only adds a single static boolean property for you to override at the class level.</p>\n\n<p>Continuing with our <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">Post</code> class:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"kt\">Post</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSSecureCoding</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">static</span> <span class=\"k\">var</span> <span class=\"nv\">supportsSecureCoding</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Bool</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">get</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n    <span class=\"c1\">// The rest of the class code omitted for brevity</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Now, the archivers will subtly change their process:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Before secure coding</span>\n<span class=\"n\">decoder</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">decodeObjectForKey</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"Posts\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// After</span>\n<span class=\"n\">decoder</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">decodeObject</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">of</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">Post</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">forKey</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Posts\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This makes all the difference, because now archivers can directly preflight its contents to ensure it has the types you expect when secure coding is used.</p>\n\n<p>Internally, this is achieved by some bookkeeping done for us by archivers creating an <em>allowed class list</em>. This list contains all of the classes that can be securely decoded and encoded. Think of it as some malformed naughty or nice list, but only real and not used by a portly man donning a red suit.</p>\n\n<p>Considering it, here’s what the process above looks like now:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">unarchiver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">decodeObject</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">of</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">Post</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">forKey</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSKeyedArchiverRootObjectKey</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// Class check would fail if it's not a post, and then return with a failure</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// Thus, this code below would no longer happen...</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">BadTerribleThings</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">alloc</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">BadTerribleThings</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">init</span><span class=\"p\">?(</span><span class=\"nv\">coder</span><span class=\"p\">:)</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">BadTerribleThings</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">awakeAfer</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">using</span><span class=\"p\">:)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can see this list yourself, as coders have a set property containing its contents: <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">aCoder.allowedClasses</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Crisis averted, but <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSSecureCoding</code> also comes with another bonus: static type checking. If you’ve got any manual decode calls with conditional downcasts, those can now go away</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Before</span>\n<span class=\"k\">guard</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">myPost</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">coder</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">decodeObject</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">forKey</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s\">\"Post\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">as?</span> <span class=\"kt\">Post</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// After</span>\n<span class=\"k\">guard</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">myPost</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">coder</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">decodeObject</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">of</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">Post</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"k\">self</span> <span class=\"nv\">forKey</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"s\">\"Post\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> \n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>However, there are a few other intricacies around subclasses to consider. If one’s class <em>doesn’t</em> override <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">init(coder:)</code>, it can still conform to <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSSecureCoding</code> without any changes if it’s a subclass of another class that does conform. Though, if it does override <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">init(coder:)</code> it also must decode any nested objects using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">decodeObjectOfClass:forKey</code>:.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"on-failing\">On Failing</h3>\n<p>When decoding fails as above, whether by a programmer’s error or malicious intent, it’s known as a secure decoding violation. Additionally, other failure states exist, such as a type mismatch (expecting an object and receiving a primitive) or perhaps the archive faces corruption.</p>\n\n<p>What happens in this scenario is entirely up to you, and you can control it via <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSDecodingPolicyFailure</code></p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">enum</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSCoder</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">NSDecodingFailurePolicy</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"n\">raiseException</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"n\">setErrorAndReturn</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The default choice is to raise an exception, but you can opt for a simple error assignment to the coder and continue execution. So, if it indeed a class injection were occurring, it’d fail and the coder would invoke <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">failWithError(_ error: Error)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Recall that Swift can’t catch Objective-C or++ exceptions, so be thoughtful here. If you’d opt for <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">setErrorAndReturn</code> the coder will have its error property set, and it would return nil. You can also tailor this error to be specific for your own use case:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Assume class injection, a failure from corruption, etc</span>\n<span class=\"k\">guard</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">post</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">unarchiver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">decodeObject</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">of</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">Post</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">forKey</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Post\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">else</span> \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">unarchiver</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">failWithError</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">CocoaError</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">error</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">coderValueNotFound</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"kc\">nil</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// obj will be nil, or 0 if its a primitive type</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// Now handle the populated error however you see fit</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"bonus-points-why-now\">Bonus Points: Why Now?</h3>\n<p>Aside from my love of writing about the outliers of iOS, why write a post about an API that’s quite old in iOS years? The answer is that I suspect more developers will be wanting for more information over it shortly. Starting with iOS 12, the legacy way of using both keyed archiver/unarchiver are now deprecated:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/images/badCoder.jpg\" alt=\"Deprecation\" /></p>\n\n<p>The deprecations means both classes gained new variants of <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nskeyedunarchiver/2983380-unarchivedobject\" target=\"_blank\">those methods</a> which allow for <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nskeyedarchiver/2962880-archiveddata\" target=\"_blank\">gated class checks</a> as well.</p>\n\n<p>Further, support for adhering on a per-class basis with the class boolean, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">supportSecureCoding</code>, was only added in iOS 10. So, with iOS 13 on the horizon - this means that the lot of us will turn to iOS 12 as our minimum build target, thus the non-secure archiving deprecation will be showing in serialization scenarios within Xcode all over the world quite soon.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>Refactoring all of ones archiving and serialization pipeline to make sure its vending the intended class might not be the most thrilling task on the backlog. But it’s a quick win, and it yields a more secure app.</p>\n\n<p>And if we’re being honest, the chances of a malicious attack targeting your app through this particular vector might be slim. But it never happens <em>until it does</em>. Plus, when the tide goes out - you can tell who was skinny dipping. Don’t be the dev who got toasted because they forgot to use a more secure archiving technique.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

For whatever reason, I was only completely focused on making these pancakes and I was having the time of my life.</p>\n\n<p>For me, that’s huge.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-i-wasnt-thinking-of\">What I Wasn’t Thinking Of</h3>\n<p>Life is busy for all of us. As a married dad of three kiddos, I find myself objectively busier than I used to be. Given that, I find that there’s times when my mental space and anxiety can constantly be playing their “Greatest Hits” album over and over:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How can I find time to release this side project?</li>\n  <li>Will it even matter when I do? <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/the-chart-that-lies\" target=\"_blank\">Time spent on it doesn’t really matter.</a></li>\n  <li>Beyond side projects, how do I do even better at my job?</li>\n  <li>Oh yeah - real life. When am I going to finish all of this laundry?</li>\n  <li>I’m so close to being out of debt, it’s exhausting putting all my disposable income towards it.</li>\n  <li>But then, do I just trade debt payments for saving for a down payment on a house? I want to enjoy my good income for once! Maybe I’ll buy a new iPad.</li>\n  <li>Hmm, that’s a lot though. Wow, you know what - it’s crazy that my oldest will need a cell phone before I know it!</li>\n  <li>Oh shoot - <strong>all</strong> of my kids will need a cell phone 😬!</li>\n  <li>and a car 😬😬,</li>\n  <li>and go to college 😬😬😬,</li>\n  <li>and also probably get married 😬😬😬😬.</li>\n  <li>💀.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The point is, I typically would not take time to make any pancakes. Let alone, during a weekday. There’s just too much to do that I simply can’t afford myself the joy of cracking open a box of premade pancake batter and seeing them through to fruition. Ouch.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"when-life-hits-you-with-a-sigabrt\">When Life Hits You with a SIGABRT()</h3>\n<p>When you find yourself thinking ahead so fast that you can’t take the time to make pancakes, or enjoy a movie on Netflix or just take 15 minutes to talk with a loved one - you have to realize that’s your brain telling you to quite literally relax.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re at this point, you might be carrying on like I do when I need to chill out but haven’t realized it yet:<br /><br />\n<strong>Did your mom call you?</strong> <em>I’ll call back later, I need to finish this post.</em> <br />\n<strong>Is it nice outside?</strong> <em>I’ll take the walk another time, this project needed to finish up yesterday.</em><br />\n<strong>A new video game out you’d enjoy?</strong> <em>I’ll play it later, I’ve gotta ship my side project now so I can learn from users, otherwise I won’t be following the lean startup principles!</em><br /></p>\n\n<p>You aren’t at all a bad person if you do these things, I think we all do. Most texts suggest ways to avoid those situations all together, but I personally don’t find that a realistic goal.</p>\n\n<p>No matter the epiphany you experience today, tomorrow or the next week you’ll eventually start back on your old ways. I think that’s healthy, actually - if we didn’t, we’d never start back in on working towards our goals again. Like anything - the answer is balance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"finding-the-pancake-moments\">Finding the Pancake Moments</h3>\n\n<p>Why was it that I felt so peaceful, calm and balanced today? Enough to wake up early and jam on some delish pancakes. I’ve yearned to answer that type of question for a long time. And, being an engineer, long ago I started to document my “pancake” moments when they did pop up to later try extrapolate why they arrived.</p>\n\n<p>What I’ve found really isn’t that exciting. There are a few commonalities among the corpus - such as a vacation or time off on the horizon, a date night with my wife, a fun event with one of my kids is coming, etc. But as I dug deeper into my Day One journal archives, I began to realize that I typically only journal when I’m at a high point.</p>\n\n<p>This was convenient for my current investigation, but the reality is that I couldn’t really nail down why sometimes I take time for myself, and other times I don’t. This time, I’d have to accept that this wasn’t a problem I could analyze several different ways and apply a few late nights to eventually uncover the answer to.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a funny aside, when I was digging through my journal during this time my wife popped around the corner and casually asked “Watcha doin?”. I said I was simply reading my journal, as saying I was in the middle of an in-depth investigation into why I can let myself relax enough to make pancakes and generally be normal was too odd of an answer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The truth is that taking time to enjoy life’s many simple pleasures isn’t something that’s a trivial matter. If it was, there wouldn’t be numerous books, conferences or classes explaining how to do it. This blog post certainly doesn’t offer up the silver bullet either.</p>\n\n<p>What we can do, then, is simply take our own advice - <em>savor</em> and <em>enjoy</em> those little “pancake” moments when they come. Even if we can’t replicate them systemically, we can take heart that there is assuredly another one on the horizon.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, just as important is being sure not to put them off. If you do, you’re the lucky winner of free conference tickets to BurnOut Conf. Neglecting some time for yourself is like putting a band-aid over a bullet hole. Eventually, you’re gonna feel it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>As indie developers, we find ourselves punishing our drive and a perceived lack-thereof if we don’t spend each free moment working towards our app, but then we put ourselves into a mental rut if we always do. But honestly, I’m kinda okay with life’s ebbs and flows - enjoying the times when I’m magnificently firing on all cylinders and all is in order, as much as the chaotic weeks where I feel like everything is just not working out.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t a novel, new or groundbreaking realization. In fact, any of your favorite authors found on the interwebs have likely written about it in their own way at some point.</p>\n\n<p>And yet - so often I find myself needing to be reminded of it.</p>\n\n<p>So if I may be so bold, perhaps you don’t need a huge life change, to work constantly to ship the side project, or read a self help book while implementing some other drastic change (or maybe you do, that’s cool too honestly).</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you just need to make some freakin’ pancakes 🥞.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>For as long as I’ve been a part of this industry, I’ve watched incredible, well-deserving apps take home an Apple Design Award. And <em>that’s</em> my endgame.</p>\n\n<p>So, years ago, I set out to create a list that succinctly answers only one question:</p>\n\n<p><strong>What things can I quantify that help make an app great?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I believe I’ve created such a list that helps answer that question. Yours might look different, but this one is mine. It attempts to takes all of the emotion and (mostly) opinions out of it. I want to capture what Apple says is great, not what other people may define it as. Though those opinions can assuredly be of value, they don’t give out A.D.A.s - only Apple does.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a quick brief on my methodology behind how I created it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>First, and most importantly, I read iOS’ Human Interface Guidelines annually from top to bottom after the GM releases of the upcoming version of iOS.</li>\n  <li>Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. If Apple has said on record that “This is great” about an app, I include whatever that thing or interaction was. These things aren’t clandestine trade secrets, but rather they are things that Apple or an Apple design evangelist publicly gave their seal of approval to.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That’s it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As always, if you’ve got an item or two that belongs on this list, by all means create a pull request to get it added in by visiting the link at the bottom of the post.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The five sections it covers are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Designing for everyone is the right thing to do, and the best apps do it and they do it exceptionally well.</li>\n  <li><strong>Platform Technology:</strong> Apple loves it when apps utilize their new APIs to great effect, you should too. It’s not about shoehorning features, it’s about looking at your product and seeing how to utilize iOS around it.</li>\n  <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> Don’t make people think. Your app should have a core function that acts a thesis to a paper - and your UX is the body that supports it.</li>\n  <li><strong>Design:</strong> Explaining design is hard, but you know a good one when you see it. This section lists some things those apps which are thoughtfully created do.</li>\n  <li><strong>App Store Presence</strong> This is by far the most nascent category I’ve been tracking, so its list is short. It includes best practices for the App Store.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"accessibility-is-first-class\">Accessibility is First Class</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Voice Over is fully supported and the rotor control is implemented by including the relevant headings. Using Screen Curtain yields an experience that’s not only usable, but up to par with the regular app using only Voice Over.</li>\n  <li>Context considering, you use <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors</code> for images and video.</li>\n  <li>Respects reduced motion and blurring user preferences.</li>\n  <li>Adaptive and supports all devices and multitasking scenarios elegantly.</li>\n  <li>Fully supports dynamic type.</li>\n  <li>Readable text uses <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">readableContentGuide</code>.</li>\n  <li>Color blind support and a 7:1 color contrast ratio.</li>\n  <li>Smart Invert Color Support and the app responds well to color inversion.</li>\n  <li>All bar buttons have their landscapeImagePhone and largeContentSizeImage properties set.</li>\n  <li>All glyphs have their accessibility images set (i.e. <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">adjustsImageSizeForAccessibilityContentSizeCategory</code>).</li>\n  <li>Includes closed captions and audio descriptions, all images and icons have alternative text set.</li>\n  <li>Leading and trailing margins are used for constraints to support left to right languages.</li>\n  <li>The User Interface appears flawlessly when tested using Double Length Pseudo-languages.</li>\n  <li>Using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSShowNonLocalizedStrings</code> yields no results.</li>\n  <li>If you support drag and drop, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/241/\">UIAccessibilityLocationDescriptors</a> are all set.</li>\n  <li>Magic taps are supported for the app’s most common functionality.</li>\n  <li>It uses <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CFBundleSpokenName</code> if the app’s name could potentially be mispronounced by the system (i..e CoolApp23 would be “CoolApp Twenty Three”).</li>\n  <li>Lastly, running the entire app through Accessibility Inspector produced no warnings and turning on Screen Curtain to navigate the app works flawlessly.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"ios-technology-is-tightly-integrated\">iOS Technology is Tightly Integrated</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>3D Touch is integrated (Peeks, home shortcuts, quick actions and interaction delegate for unique experiences).</li>\n  <li>Spotlight search and indexing support.</li>\n  <li>Effective energy management (i.e. supports low power mode and reacts to it)</li>\n  <li>Keyboard shortcuts have been added.

Great examples are Calendar and Photos.</li>\n  <li>You opt for vector assets to combat the differing resolutions and avoid any blurry assets.</li>\n  <li>Your content is always the focus, and you constantly challenge if that’s true throughout the development cycles.</li>\n  <li>Particular and specific user experience guidelines are followed:\n    <ul>\n      <li>No segment controls are used in toolbars.</li>\n      <li>There are no toolbars and tab bars in the same screen.</li>\n      <li>Destructive actions are the top choice in action sheets.</li>\n      <li>Alerts, if used, ideally have to two choices and titles have no punctuation.

Take it piece by piece and work your way down.</p>\n\n<p>And, as a wise honey-loving bear once said, “I get to where I’m going by walking away from where I’ve been.” If your app might lack some polish, better now more than ever to spend some time giving it some.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

In programming parlance we consider this distinction as <em>frozen</em> and <em>unfrozen</em> enumerations.</p>\n\n<p>For an unfrozen enumeration (likely the lot of them), additional cases are likely coming in future API changes:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">typedef</span> <span class=\"kt\">NS_ENUM</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSUInteger</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kt\">AccountType</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeNew</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeExisting</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeUnknown</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Later on, another case could be added</span>\n<span class=\"n\">typedef</span> <span class=\"kt\">NS_ENUM</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSUInteger</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kt\">AccountType</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeNew</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeExisting</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeMigrated</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeUnknown</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Whereas other situations call for a certain degree of finality, such as <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">FloatingPointSign</code> from within the Swift Standard Library:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">sign</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">FloatingPointSign</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">minus</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">switch</span> <span class=\"n\">sign</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">minus</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">plus</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"swiftly-business\">Swiftly Business</h3>\n<p>The differences in approach between the two languages are vast and wide when dealing with enumerations. Recall that Objective-C supports storing any value in an enumeration, so as long as it matches the underlying type:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">typedef</span> <span class=\"kt\">NS_ENUM</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSUInteger</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kt\">AccountType</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeNew</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeExisting</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeUnknown</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Later on, assignment...</span>\n<span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">934</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Or control flow...</span>\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountType</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">243</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"c1\">// It's all totally legal</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>In Swift, that’s no fly zone territory:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Cannot assign value of type 'Int' to type 'AccountType'</span>\n<span class=\"k\">self</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">934</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">account</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountType</span> <span class=\"o\">==</span> <span class=\"mi\">34</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\">// This errs as well, unless one initializes an Int with the enum's rawValue.    </span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>But where things really become tightened up in Swift is within a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">switch</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// If we omit default, we'll err since the switch isn't exhaustive. Or leave out a break.</span>\n<span class=\"k\">switch</span> <span class=\"n\">account</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountType</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">existing</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">new</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Here, Swift is the straight A student who buckles their seat belt before starting their engine. Objective-C wouldn’t mind driving blindfolded:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Really anything goes. Leave out a break. Don't use all the cases. Just whatever with a side of YOLO.</span>\n<span class=\"k\">switch</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">account</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountType</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeNew</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"k\">break</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>And you can see where the issues come into play. Though we can’t do much in terms of safety with Objective-C, we can vend more intent to Swift consumers of their enumerations by marking them as either frozen or unfrozen. Doing so yields a subtle but welcome change for Swift API consumers.</p>\n\n<p>Enter NS_CLOSED_ENUM.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"freezing-enumerations\">Freezing Enumerations</h3>\n<p>Though our account type example enumeration is ripe for future mutations, let’s consider one that isn’t:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">typedef</span> <span class=\"kt\">NS_CLOSED_ENUM</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSUInteger</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kt\">AccountStandingStatus</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountStandingStatusFreeTrial</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountStandingStatusPaid</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountStandingStatusOwes</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Here, our business needs dictated that an account will ever only be in one of three states. Forever. When bridged over to Swift, usage might look like so:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">switch</span> <span class=\"n\">account</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountStanding</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">freeTrial</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">owes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">paid</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">@unknown</span> <span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Note that a default case can’t alert the compiler that a particular enumeration has elements that aren’t explicitly handled in the switch. For this reason, Swift added a new attribute in Swift 4 for switches, @unknown. Using it will act as a huge safety net, a catch-all. A key difference is that a warning will still be produced to let developers know they’ve missed a case.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, intent is the most valued prize to engineers both from a maintainer’s perspective as well as a consumer’s one. Though @unknown is useful for letting one know they’ve missed a case; even better is to communicate that they don’t need a default case at all. YAGNI.</p>\n\n<p>We can use NS_CLOSED_ENUM here to signify things will, and forever more, stay the same:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">typedef</span> <span class=\"kt\">NS_CLOSED_ENUM</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">NSUInteger</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"kt\">AccountStandingStatus</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountStandingStatusFreeTrial</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountStandingStatusPaid</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountStandingStatusOwes</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Now Swift can guarantee that the additional <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">default</code> is unnecessary, but notice how no warning is generated for our unfrozen enumeration, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">AccountType</code>:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">account</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">Account</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"n\">account</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">existing</span>\n<span class=\"n\">account</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountStanding</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">paid</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">switch</span> <span class=\"n\">account</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountType</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">existing</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">new</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">unknown</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">@unknown</span> <span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Still useful, because new types could later be added</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">switch</span> <span class=\"n\">account</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">accountStanding</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">freeTrial</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">owes</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nv\">paid</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">@unknown</span> <span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"k\">break</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Case is already handled by previous patterns; consider removing it</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Though this clearly enhances life with Swift, I’d argue this can be a valuable addition to any Objective-C exclusive code base. If you’re browsing a header, the intent of the enumeration’s status (both current and future) are clear by either the use of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NS_ENUM</code> versus <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NS_CLOSED_ENUM</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"choices\">Choices</h3>\n<p>It’s worth considering which type of enumeration to use with Objective-C at this point. We’ve got enum, NS_ENUM or NS_CLOSED_ENUM. Fortunately, the answer is much simpler than you  might think.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>NS_OPTIONS is also a choice, but is more suited towards bitmasks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The old C way of defining an enumeration, which by proxy Objective-C gained by virtue of being a superset, could lead to confusion. Look to <a href=\"https://nshipster.com/ns_enum-ns_options/\" target=\"_blank\">NSHipster’s</a> excellent post over the topic, but to jog your memory:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// There's no type. Only Integer values</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">enum</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeNew</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeExisting</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeUnknown</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// or a specified type</span>\n<span class=\"n\">typedef</span> <span class=\"kd\">enum</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeNew</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeExisting</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeUnknown</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// or Apple's old way of doing things,</span>\n<span class=\"n\">typedef</span> <span class=\"kd\">enum</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeNew</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeExisting</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kt\">AccountTypeUnknown</span>\n<span class=\"p\">};</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">typedef</span> <span class=\"kt\">NSInteger</span> <span class=\"kt\">AccountType</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>To provide explicit hints to the compiler, one should always opt for NS_ENUM as we’ve done in the previous examples. We’ll get switch case completeness along with our type checking.</p>\n\n<p>Now, with NS_CLOSED_ENUM, the only <em>additional</em> question you’ve got ask yourself is if this enumeration is frozen or not. That’s it:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Don’t use enum</li>\n  <li>If it’s unfrozen, opt for NS_ENUM</li>\n  <li>If it’s frozen, use NS_CLOSED_ENUM</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the choice to use a frozen enumeration is final. The header for a closed enumeration communicates this plainly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once an enum is marked as closed, it is a binary and source incompatible change to add a new value. If there is any doubt about an enum gaining a private or additional public case in the future, use NS_ENUM instead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>If Objective-C was “deprecated” tomorrow, the traveled software developer knows that in programming there is but one truth: what is dead never truly dies.</p>\n\n<p>Interop with old faithful (Objective-C) isn’t going away anytime soon, as much as the prevailing narrative may have you believe. Sure, the Swift only frameworks are en route, no doubt, but so long as Foundation holds its firm grip in the iOS ecosystem - we can bet the dinosaur will still roam its plains.</p>\n\n<p>As such, we should take care to integrate the changing of the guard in delightful ways, and NS_CLOSED_ENUM is an indefectible definition in that regard.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>There is a certain optimism that surrounds your side project to others in your immediate circle. Take my wife, for example. What has she seen me do for the past several years?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Stay up late coding.</li>\n  <li>Get up early designing.</li>\n  <li>Finding any ounce of free time to squash a bug.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To her, the whole thing is quite admirable. The undeniable grip that takes hold over developers when they hatch a side project is a cosmic force that requires a first hand account to be adequately understood.</p>\n\n<p>As such, they might view our side project’s shot at success a little something like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/images/col.jpg\" alt=\"The Chart of Lies\" /></p>\n\n<p>In theory, that seems reasonable. In practice, it’s nothing but smoke and mirrors.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-we-hope-for\">What We Hope For</h3>\n<p>People are creatures of habit. We’ve grown up applying a certain formula for success that doesn’t transcend over to software development. That formula looks a little like this:</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">effortPutIn + experience + talent = success</code></p>\n\n<p>It’s ingrained into our D.N.A. early on, as well it should be. I even tell my oldest son, who is obsessed with basketball, that all of his hard work will pay off. And it likely will, too.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Practice shooting daily? Make the shot in the game.</li>\n  <li>Studied for the test? Get a good grade.</li>\n  <li>Ate less pizza and worked out more? Get a fit body.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But in the world of apps, we know this doesn’t hold water:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Spend years on an app? Get a million downloads.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For indie developers, hard work can very well mean close to nothing in terms of downloads.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-we-get\">What We Get</h3>\n<p>I don’t say any of this to discourage you. Hang with me, though. We’re trying to create and release software in a place where:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Exposure means everything, but it’s far from guaranteed.</li>\n  <li>The biggest names in publishing are manning marketing machines to accomplish the very same goals that you are.</li>\n  <li>Consumers have been taught (by us, no doubt) that they really don’t need to pay us anything to gain value from the things we make.</li>\n  <li>The apps that they <em>did</em> take a chance on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/sneaky-subscriptions-are-plaguing-the-app-store/\" target=\"_blank\">possibly left a terrible taste in their mouth.</a></li>\n  <li>And of course, the store you’re putting your creation in has 1,000s of new entries daily.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That description doesn’t exactly make for a good one sheet, does it? The point is that the time I’m spending developing my app, commercially speaking - could be time wasted.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-realistic-chart\">The Realistic Chart</h3>\n<p>There is reason for optimism though, and at this point I think it’s only fair to lay a little bit of sunshine down. Time spent on your app, certainly, is part of your path to success.</p>\n\n<p>And if I’ve done one thing, I have given it time.</p>\n\n<p>I joke that my side project is <em>kids</em> years old. I initially envisioned and released the first version when my oldest, Bennett, arrived (he’s now 5), I was redesigning it when Remy was born (he’s two) and I’m gearing up for release now that my youngest (Baylor) is 5 months old. <strong>My app is three kids years old.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Having a side project while being married, a parent of three and having a full time career is akin to undertaking concurrent programming blindfolded. You’re hoping to achieve all these tasks in anything but a synchronous queue - while knowing full well you’re going to deadlock anyways. No matter what.</p>\n\n<p>The good part is that a lot of little things help make an app great, of which time is only an ancillary component. Here is a chart that more closely relays the truth:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/images/cot.jpg\" alt=\"A More Realistic Chart\" /></p>\n\n<p>It’s a thousand little things, a high degree of quality, a problem worth solving having been solved, some happenstance, lucky breaks and market fit that will make your app succeed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"know-your-why\">Know Your “Why”</h3>\n<p>The part that keeps me motivated, though - is that <em>you</em> get to define what success looks like. It’s mutable, and typically it means something a little bit different to all of us with some evergreen themes attached to each of the definitions we hold. Though the playful charts show a dollar sign to signify success, it doesn’t have to look like that for you.</p>\n\n<p>So, what’s success in your case?</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"are-you-trying-to-be-commercially-successful-are-you-actively-trying-to-make-something-that-could-take-hold-of-the-market\">Are you trying to be commercially successful? Are you actively trying to make something that could take hold of the market?</h4>\n\n<p>It’s probably wise to release quickly and learn. You’re acutely aware of the chart that lies, and the speed with which you approach the App Store is your primary weapon to wield against it. You know there’s nothing wrong with wanting to make a buck, and you believe it can still be done in the market while carving out a space for yourself to earn some of the annual record breaking dollars consumers are spending within it.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, maybe you’re closer to how I think about developing an app:</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"are-you-a-hobbyist-who-might-be-obsessed-with-the-details-do-you-consider-your-app-an-open-canvas-and-yourself-the-craftsmen\">Are you a hobbyist who might be obsessed with the details? Do you consider your app an open canvas, and yourself the craftsmen?</h4>\n\n<p>Is releasing something that you can feel proud to put your name on key to you? Do you want it to be so intricately woven and tactfully integrated into the iOS platform that it wouldn’t feel out of place alongside the best in the business? Would you consider tuning data source updates carefully to perform batch animations anything but a vapid endeavor?</p>\n\n<p>Fantastic! Let’s have coffee together!</p>\n\n<p>We can wax poetic about which H.I.G. rules to follow religiously and which to toss aside. Let’s chat about the myriad of possibilities this wonderful world opens up for us to create. We can hammer home that the things we painfully left out of our software were equally as important as the parts we left in.</p>\n\n<p>But devs like us, we <em>really</em> have to be cognizant of the chart that lies. As times goes on, we start believing in it and consider the time we’ve spent will breed success instead of the real, tangible reasons that make an app work. I’d urge you to think realistically about it. If you chart the same path I’m on with your app, realize you’re riding off a lot of assumptions.</p>\n\n<p>All of the time spent is great, it means something - but it owes us absolutely nothing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"that-money-thing\">That Money Thing</h3>\n<p>Regardless of the path you choose, it doesn’t have to be squarely about the money, but you do need to make <em>some</em> money to truly care about it. At least I do. Tell me how motivated you’d truly be if week after week you keep showing a movie that nobody wants to see.</p>\n\n<p>Plus, the almighty dollar is an adroit motivator. But, it can be but a small facet of why you develop an app. I think I’ve found this middle ground where I’m certainly not going full-on lean startup, but I’m not eschewing the reality of what users in the market will think or how they’ll react when they get my app in their hands.</p>\n\n<p>I want them to love it. But the only way I’ll ever know if they will is if I actually release it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>If you find yourself hanging your hat on the chart of lies, don’t feel embarrassed. It’s only natural that as time passes, you become more attached to your “baby”. As such, it couldn’t possibly end up as anything other than great, <em>right</em>?</p>\n\n<p>The App Store tells us a different story. Does your app resonate with the audience you’re after or will it be coldly ushered into non-existence without so much as a download? Take care to not let that thought discourage you, but be aware that it exists.</p>\n\n<p>Savor developing your creation, but remember that time doesn’t necessarily breed success. Only a great app does.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

If that adage holds any weight, then without question - stem to stern the iPhone is the most important camera on the planet. And our industry shows it, too.</p>\n\n<p>On a vacation? It didn’t happen if it’s not documented on your Instagram story with several candid shots.</p>\n\n<p>Breaking news? Check Twitter and see what outlets are reporting on by peeping their photos of an event unfolding in real time.</p>\n\n<p>Etcetera.</p>\n\n<p>But for all of their ubiquity on the platform, the act of showing them in a performant and memory conservative manner can easily turn into a mismanaged endeavor. With a little know how as to what’s happening in UIKit and why in regards to how it treats images, one can gain some massive savings and forgo the unrelenting wrath of jetsam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"in-theory\">In Theory</h3>\n<p>Pop quiz - how much memory will this 266 kilobyte (and quite dashing) photo of my beautiful daughter require in an iOS app?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/images/baylor.jpg\" alt=\"Baylor\" /></p>\n\n<p>Spoiler alert - it’s not 266 kilobytes. It’s not 2.66 megabytes. It’s around <em>14 megabytes</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n<p>iOS essentially derives its memory hit from an image’s <em>dimensions</em> - whereas the actual file size has much less to do with it. And the dimensions for this photo sit at 1718 pixels wide by 2048 pixels tall. Assuming each pixel will cost us four bytes:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"mi\">1718</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">2048</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">4</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"mi\">1024</span> <span class=\"o\">/</span> <span class=\"mi\">1024</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mf\">13.42</span> <span class=\"n\">megabytes</span> <span class=\"n\">give</span> <span class=\"n\">or</span> <span class=\"n\">take</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>Imagine if you’ve got a table view with a list of users, and each row shows the now pervasive circle avatar of their photo to the left. If you’re thinking things are kosher because each one has been packed up nice and tight from ImageOptim or something similar, that might not be the case. If each one is a conservative 256x256 you could still be taking quite a hit on memory.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-rendering-pipeline\">The Rendering Pipeline</h3>\n<p>All that to say - it’s worth knowing what’s going on under the hood. When you load up an image, it’s going to be processed in three steps:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>Load</strong> - iOS takes the compressed image and loads (in our example) the 266 kilobyte into memory. Really no worries yet.<br />\n2) <strong>Decode</strong> - Now, iOS takes the image and converts into a way the GPU can read and understand. It’s now uncompressed, and it’s here we’re at the 14MB size listed above. <br />\n3) <strong>Render</strong> - Just like it sounds, the image data is ready and willing to be rendered any which way. Even if it’s just by a 60 by 60 point image view.<br /></p>\n\n<p>The decoding phase is the big one. Here, iOS has created a buffer - specifically an image buffer, that’s got an in-memory representation of the image. So it stands to reason that this size is intrinsically tied to the proportions of the image itself and not its file size. This paints a clear picture of why the dimensions are so important when it comes to your memory consumption when working with images.</p>\n\n<p>For <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> in particular, when we give it image data we received from a network hit or some other source, it decodes that data buffer to whatever compression the data says it’s encoded in (think PNG or JPEG). However, it’ll actually hang onto it as well. Since rendering is not a one shot operation, the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> keeps that image buffer around so it’s only decoding things one time.</p>\n\n<p>Expanding on this idea - one integral buffer for any iOS app is its frame buffer. This is what’s responsible for actually showing your iOS app as it appears on screen since it holds the rendered output of its contents. The display hardware on any iOS device uses this per-pixel information to literally illuminate the very pixels on the physical screen.</p>\n\n<p>And timing matters here. To get the buttery smooth 60 frames per second scrolling, the frame buffer will need to have UIKit render the app’s window and it’s subsequent subviews into it when their information changes (i.e. assigning an image to an image view). If you do that slow, you drop a frame.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Think 1/60th of a second is short on time? Pro Motion devices up the ante to 1/120th of a second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"size-does-matter\">Size Does Matter</h3>\n<p>We can visualize this process and memory being consumed pretty easily.

So if I’m on a 3x or 2x device then you could potentially multiply that number even more so. Let’s take a quick trip down <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">vmmap</code> to see if we can confirm that around 14 megabytes are being used from this one image:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">vmmap</span> <span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">summary</span> <span class=\"n\">baylor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">memgraph</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>A few things stick out (truncated for brevity):</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">Physical</span> <span class=\"nv\">footprint</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>         <span class=\"mf\">69.5</span><span class=\"kt\">M</span>\n<span class=\"kt\">Physical</span> <span class=\"nf\">footprint</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">peak</span><span class=\"p\">):</span>  <span class=\"mf\">69.7</span><span class=\"kt\">M</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>We’re sitting at almost 70 megabytes which gives us a nice baseline to confirm any refactor against. If we grep down into Image IO we can likely see some of the cost of our image as well:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">vmmap</span> <span class=\"o\">--</span><span class=\"n\">summary</span> <span class=\"n\">baylor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">memgraph</span> <span class=\"o\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">grep</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Image IO\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">Image</span> <span class=\"kt\">IO</span>  <span class=\"mf\">13.4</span><span class=\"kt\">M</span>   <span class=\"mf\">13.4</span><span class=\"kt\">M</span>   <span class=\"mf\">13.4</span><span class=\"kt\">M</span>    <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"kt\">K</span>  <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"kt\">K</span>  <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"kt\">K</span>   <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"kt\">K</span>  <span class=\"mi\">2</span> \n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Ah - there’s about 14 megabytes of dirty memory right there. That’s what our back-of-the-napkin math hypothesized our image would cost. For context, here’s a quick screenshot of Terminal to clearly illustrate what each column means since they were omitted from our greppin’:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/images/vmmap.jpg\" alt=\"Baylor\" /></p>\n\n<p>So clearly, we’re paying the full cost of the image in our 300 x 400 image view at this point. The size of the image can be key, but it’s also not the only thing that matters.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"color-space\">Color Space</h3>\n<p>Part of the memory you’ll be requesting for is determined by yet another important factor - the color space. In the example above we made an assumption that likely isn’t the case with most iPhones - that the image was utilizing the sRGB format. The 4 bytes per pixel is figured up by giving one byte for red, blue, green and the alpha component.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re shooting with a device that supports the wide color format (for example, an iPhone 8+ or iPhone X) then you likely can double the hit across the board. Of course, the reverse is true as well. Metal can use the Alpha 8 format which has only a single channel to its name.</p>\n\n<p>It can be a lot to manage and think about. This is one reason why you should use <a href=\"http://localhost:4000/UIGraphicsImageRenderer\" target=\"_blank\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</a> instead of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions</code>. The latter will <em>always</em> use sRGB which means you could miss the wide format if you <a href=\"https://instagram-engineering.com/bringing-wide-color-to-instagram-5a5481802d7d\" target=\"_blank\">want it</a>, or miss out on the savings if you’re going smaller. As of iOS 12, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</code> is going to pick the right one for you.</p>\n\n<p>Lest we forget, a lot of images that crop up aren’t really of the photographed variety but rather trivial drawing operations.

But it typically won’t due to the reasons above, and it’s also not as performant due to internal coordinate space transforms according to Apple’s Kyle Howarth.</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> becomes an issue here primarily because it will decompress the <em>original image</em> into memory as we discussed when looking at the rendering pipeline.

If we compare the 69.5M from before to the 56.3M now we get a savings of 13.2M. That’s a <em>huge</em> savings, almost the whole cost of the image.</p>\n\n<p>Further, you can play around with the many options available to hone things for your use case. In session 219, “Images and Graphics Best Practices” from WWDC 18, Apple engineer Kyle Sluder showed an interesting way to control when decoding happens by using the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately</code> flag:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"nf\">downsampleImage</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">at</span> <span class=\"kt\">URL</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">NSURL</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">maxSize</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kt\">Float</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIImage</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">sourceOptions</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">kCGImageSourceShouldCache</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kc\">false</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"kt\">CFDictionary</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">source</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGImageSourceCreateWithURL</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">URL</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"kt\">CFURL</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">sourceOptions</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">!</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">downsampleOptions</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nv\">kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                             <span class=\"nv\">kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">maxSize</span>\n                             <span class=\"nv\">kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                             <span class=\"nv\">kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n                             <span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"kt\">CFDictionary</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">downsampledImage</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">source</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">downsampleOptions</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"o\">!</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIImage</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">cgImage</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">downsampledImage</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Here Core Graphics won’t bother decoding the image until you specifically ask for the thumbnail. Also, take care to pass <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailMaxPixelSize</code> as we’ve done in both examples because if you don’t - you’re getting back a thumbnail which is the same size of the image. From the docs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“…if a maximum pixel size isn’t specified, then the thumbnail will be the size of the full image, which probably isn’t what you want.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So what happened? In short, we created a much smaller decoded image buffer than before by putting the shrinking part of equation into a thumbnail. Thinking back on our rendering pipeline, for the first part (the load) we instead passed an image buffer that represented only the size of the image view we’re showing it in instead of reflecting the entire image’s dimensions for the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> to decode.</p>\n\n<p>Want a TL;DR for this entire article? Look for opportunities to downsample images instead of using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIImage</code> to downscale them.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bonus-points\">Bonus Points</h3>\n<p>I personally use this in tandem with the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitableviewdatasourceprefetching?language=swift\">prefetch API</a> introduced in iOS 11. Remember that we’re inherently introducing spikes in CPU usage since we’re decoding images even if we’re doing it ahead of when the table or collection view might need our cell.</p>\n\n<p>Since iOS is efficient at managing power demand when there is a constant need for it and in this case it’ll likely be intermittent, it’s good to hop on your own queue to tackle something like this. This also moves the decoding to the background, which is another significant win.</p>\n\n<p>Cover your eyes, Objective-C code sample from my side project incoming:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift

Why spend time going over an API that hasn’t seen significant changes circa 2011?</p>\n\n<p>It seemed like the session was being conducted by a preacher with no pulpit. However, with the recently announced iPad Pro sporting USB-C 3.1 capabilities, the missing context is now present. Today, let’s talk about supporting external displays in our iOS apps.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"window-quotes\">Window Quotes</h3>\n<p>It all begins with a homologically titled object in UIKit, the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIWindow</code>, and respecting the responsibilities that it represents. At its core, a window acts as a container for anything that should be on screen. We often don’t think of it much beyond its initial setup within the app delegate:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">func</span> <span class=\"nf\">application</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">_</span> <span class=\"nv\">application</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIApplication</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</span> <span class=\"nv\">launchOptions</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Any</span><span class=\"p\">]?)</span> <span class=\"o\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"kt\">Bool</span> \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">controller</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">ViewController</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"n\">window</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIWindow</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">window</span><span class=\"p\">?</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">rootViewController</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">controller</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">window</span><span class=\"p\">?</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">makeKeyAndVisible</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    \n    <span class=\"k\">return</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If your app uses storyboards, the above is done for you. This is one reason why Xcode templates its app delegate objects with a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIWindow</code> property.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With that, we end up with a hierarchy that is stacked up like so, from bottom to top:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Device</li>\n  <li>Window</li>\n  <li>View (from the window’s root controller)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Typically, it’s fine to move on and not think much about it. A window won’t do anything more than pass on any relevant events to its root controller (which in turn travels the down responder chain with its associated views). It provides no visible content of its own, merely acting as a harbinger of sorts for things happenings that would affect its root controller.</p>\n\n<p>But its utility lies in the fact that your iOS app can break free from the confines of an any iPhone or iPad (…or iPod touch, I guess) by way of being connected to another display.</p>\n\n<p>And Apple <em>really</em> wants us to know that the new iPad Pro is ready for such occasions. By default, when iOS detects another screen UIKit will mirror the key window’s contents. But, look at the marketing for the Pro:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"../assets/images/lookNewScreen.jpg\" alt=\"External Display\" /></p>\n\n<p>If you inspect the image closer you’ll notice that what’s showing on the monitor versus what’s on the iPad are <em>different</em>. <strong>This</strong> is the opportunity Apple wants developers to be aware of. Let’s walk through it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-setup\">The Setup</h3>\n<p>When thinking about how to be a first class citizen for supporting external displays, there really isn’t much involved from an engineering perspective. In the aforementioned WWDC session, three main concerns are laid out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Connectivity: Handling the presence of another display.</li>\n  <li>Behavior: How your app should respond to that connection.</li>\n  <li>Connection Transitions: Handling the removal of another display.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"connectivity\">Connectivity</h3>\n<p>The first logical step is to be aware of when one should prepare interfaces for an external display. UIKit offers us two discrete responsibilities to consider. The first is the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIScreen</code> singleton, which has an array of screens the app is tracking:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"k\">var</span> <span class=\"nv\">screens</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"kt\">UIScreen</span><span class=\"p\">]</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"k\">get</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This is where we can snag a reference to the screen we need. In addition to housing a controller and its views, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIWindow</code> also has an assignable <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIScreen</code> property. With it, we can control which screen each window should display its contents on.</p>\n\n<p>The process looks similar to the following:</p>\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">externalScreen</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIScreen</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">screens</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">last</span> \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">externalWindow</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIWindow</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">externalWindow</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">screen</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">externalScreen</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">externalWindow</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">rootViewController</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIViewController</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">externalWindow</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isHidden</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By default, a window’s screen property is set to the hardware’s current screen. For a window that’ll show unique content on an external display, set it before you show the window as switching screens on an already displayed window carries significant performance costs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s at this point that you’d want to supply the relevant content to the new window’s <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">rootViewController</code> property. So, for the image above showing the iPad Pro, Apple has created a controller that just shows the primary content and not the editing tools below it (as on the iPad’s screen).</p>\n\n<p>The execution is easy to follow, but knowing when to do the work above is accomplished by way of Cocoa Touch’s oldest broadcasting network - <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSNotification</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, there are two:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSNotification.Name.UIScreenDidConnect</code></li>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">NSNotification.Name.UIScreenDidDisconnect</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you were wondering why we set the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">screen</code> property on the window to the last instance in the array, this is why.

All of that interactivity will still be driven by the iOS device. This means that you’ll want to set things up accordingly, likely reserving all this new screen real estate to display the marquee parts of your content.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why is simple - the external display likely won’t have touch controls. I say likely because, to wit, the only way I suppose it <em>could</em> is if it’s another iOS device using external display software.</p>\n\n<p>Unlikely edge case notwithstanding, the main idea is that it’s a giant projected display, so treat it like one:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">extDisplayShowing</span> \n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">presentContentOnExternalDisplay</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">content</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"k\">else</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">contentDisplayController</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIContentDisplayViewController</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">with</span> <span class=\"nv\">content</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">content</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">navigationController</span><span class=\"p\">?</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">pushViewController</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">contentDisplayController</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">animated</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>The paradigm is different. This is your chance to show off the most important, public components of your content while ensuring control of said content stays snuggly nestled within the iOS device.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"connection-transitions\">Connection Transitions</h3>\n<p>The last piece laid out by the fine engineers of Cupertino during the session was this idea of “connection transitions”, but really it’s chiefly concerned with the first step.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, as iOS engineers there is one thing we must always strive to keep for users: context.</p>\n\n<p>It’s incredibly frustrating to use an app that doesn’t respect it. Tap a row with a disclosure indicator, and instead of pushing onto the navigation stack you get some off beat modal transition. Or if there is a side menu, tapping it <em>does</em> do a push. It’s weird, and you know it when you see it. Ambiguity in software is inherently taxing to the end user, so it’s best to avoid it.</p>\n\n<p>When you receive a connect or disconnect notice, strive to keep the current context and flow of your app maintained. For our example above, it might look  something like this :</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">NotificationCenter</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">addObserver</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">forName</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">UIScreenDidDisconnect</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">object</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">nil</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">nil</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">disconnectNotice</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">contentDisplayController</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIContentDisplayViewController</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">with</span> <span class=\"nv\">content</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"n\">content</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">navigationController</span><span class=\"p\">?</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">pushViewController</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">contentDisplayController</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">animated</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">true</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">NotificationCenter</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"k\">default</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">addObserver</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">forName</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"kt\">UIScreenDidConnect</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">object</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">nil</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">queue</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kc\">nil</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">connectNotice</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">presentContentOnExternalDisplay</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">content</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If your app is suspended when a notification arrives, UIKit delivers it when your app begins running again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s about thinking of any context that <em>could</em> be lost from any of these transitions that should later be restored. So, be thinking about currently selected index paths, selected content or view hierarchies that you might need to do some bookkeeping for to later restore.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"when-and-why\">When, and Why</h3>\n<p>To me, real craftsmanship shows through when external display support is provided in a way that, forgive my stereotypical phrase - truly enhances the app’s experience.</p>\n\n<p>Think of Keynote. The iOS app can turn into a clicker to present the slides, or a game that houses controls locally on the phone but projects meaningful game play on your giant TV. External display support really shines here - whereas an app like <a href=\"https://www.streaksworkout.com\" target=\"_blank\">Streaks Workout</a> does just fine with mirroring its contents. It doesn’t stand to gain anything by providing any other support to external displays.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a matter of real life access control. Public or private. Your iOS device is almost always private. All of us get a little nervous when projecting it onto a huge screen in the office to show just that <em>one</em> picture. But like programming, we must consider context. The external display is public - so ask yourself what your app might stand to gain, if anything, by making content publicly shown that’s entirely unique to its display.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h3>\n<p>If hipster culture has taught us anything, perhaps its unintentional wisdom shows us that sometimes what’s old is new again. Supporting external windows doesn’t require any shiny new API, and the process of how to do it isn’t lighting up your Twitter feed.</p>\n\n<p>But the core ethos of iOS development is marrying hardware with software, and promoting their tight coupling with startlingly efficient execution. So I would submit to you, supporting and coding against external display support is absolutely nothing new - but it is more <em>relevant</em> to us than it was before <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/new-ipad-pro-with-all-screen-design-is-most-advanced-powerful-ipad-ever/\">Apple’s event</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",

Among them, digital photography is one of the more exciting bits of its history. It’s still quite a nascent craft, with its history tracing back to as recently as 1957 when the fine folks at the National Institute of Standards and Technology slapped a photo into computer memory.</p>\n\n<p>The translation from the analog to the digital was an inflection point. We’ve experienced a similar shift on iOS starting with iOS 10, though many engineers have yet to discover or adopt the latest innovation for drawing images — <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</code>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"setting-the-cgcontext\">Setting the (CG)Context</h3>\n<p>Core Graphics, based on the Quartz drawing engine, has provided iOS developers with lightweight 2D rendering capabilities since iOS 2. Its utility knows almost no bounds, as image masking, PDF document creation, parsing, and other similar functions are baked right in making it a no nonsense choice for any sort of drawing task.</p>\n\n<p>For that and many other reasons, if one hits the Googles on how to create an image from something on screen they’ll likely end up with something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">drawSize</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGSize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsBeginImageContext</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">drawSize</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">ctx</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"o\">!</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">ctx</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">setFillColor</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">UIColor</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">red</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">cgColor</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n<span class=\"n\">ctx</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">fill</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">CGRect</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">x</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">y</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">drawSize</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">width</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">drawSize</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">height</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">img</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>And it works, so we move on. Though, there are several valid reasons to pump the breaks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>UIGraphicsBegin/EndImageContext are sRGB only (sorry p3 color gamut).</li>\n  <li>It was before the age of blocks, which are common throughout Foundation, UIKit and virtually every framework on iOS.</li>\n  <li>Extensibility is possible, though sometimes a non trivial task.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Given its age, it’s not a shocker to say Core Graphics provides an API that’s less than ideal too many of today’s standards. Though Swift’s syntactical sugar prowess has softened the call sites to Core Graphics code over many projects, it still is what it is — a C based API built for simpler times.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</code> is built for tomorrow in mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>It’s automagically fully color managed. For example, on the beautiful 9.7 inch iPad pro you’ll get a wide color context.</li>\n  <li>It’s a first class object.</li>\n  <li>It manages its context lifetime, unlocking some memory optimizations on the house from Cupertino &amp; Friends©.</li>\n  <li>The former implicitly means that it caches its context, meaning reuse is an efficient operation as opposed to using new renderers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"gaining-more-cgcontext\">Gaining More (CG)Context</h3>\n\n<p>Initializing and keeping a reference to a renderer is a solid start:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift

id=\"giving-a-renderer-more-cgcontext\">Giving a Renderer More (CG)Context</h3>\n<p>I really need to stop with the (CG)Context bit, but I feel too invested at this point so please just excuse me 🤠.</p>\n\n<p>You have noticed that a graphics renderer will also accept a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</code>object into two of its four available initializers:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"nf\">init</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">size</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGSize</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">format</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>  \n<span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"nf\">init</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">bounds</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGRect</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">format</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This rendering format has a few options to aid in further specifying the intent of your resulting drawing operations. It also has a useful <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">bounds </code>property we’ve been using in the previous code samples that’s derived from its associated graphics context. Using this formatter one can tweak opaque or scale preferences, among other things.</p>\n\n<p>For example, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">CALayer</code> and its A8 backing store format was introduced in iOS 12 and provides developers with free memory optimizations. If you’re certain, for example, that you’re drawing wide color content <em>using</em> sRGB colors, you can have the renderer optimize for that since the backing store would otherwise be larger to accommodate a larger color range rather than just 0 to 1:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// iOS 10/11</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">format</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>  \n<span class=\"n\">format</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">prefersExtendedRange</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kc\">false</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// iOS 12</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">format</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>  \n<span class=\"n\">format</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">preferredRange</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">standard</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Turn off iOS 12 optimization</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Many of these decisions will likely be tied to the current trait collection, so it stands to reason that the renderer format can also be fetched on a per trait collection basis as well.</p>\n\n<p>No need to mince in my own words here, Apple’s documentation explains this very well:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"c1\">// Returns a format optimized for the specified trait collection, taking into account properties such as displayScale and displayGamut.</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">// Traits that are not specified will be ignored, with their corresponding format properties defaulting to the values in preferredFormat.  </span>\n<span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">convenience</span> <span class=\"nf\">init</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"nv\">traitCollection</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">UITraitCollection</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>No worries if you opt to forgo any of this, as UIKit provides sensible default values for you should you not provide explicit ones. As such, if you do nothing, UIKit gives you the resulting format from its factory method, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">defaultFormat</code> — which provides a format configured for the highest fidelity possible as supported by the device it’s executed on.</p>\n\n<p>Take care to make this choice upfront, however. If you want to configure things, do it at your renderer’s initialization point as the formatter itself holistically represents immutable configurations that it will always use during drawing operations.</p>\n\n<p>All of this hopefully should remind you how extensible and flexible an image renderer can be. For example, hanging a quick extension off of any view to create a circle avatar would be painless and performant (as performant as using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">cornerRadius</code> can really be, that is) since one could reuse the same renderer and its context:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span

This is done via the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UITextInputPasswordRules</code> class:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">createNewPasswordTextField</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UITextField</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">newPasswordReqs</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UITextInputPasswordRules</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">descriptor</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"required: lower; required: digit; max-consecutive: 3; minlength: 12;\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">createNewPasswordTextField</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">passwordRules</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">newPasswordReqs</span>\n\n<span class=\"c1\">// Now, when iOS suggests a new password - these rules will be used to generate it</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>The pertinent information here is the descriptor parameter, which is a plain string that follows a certain syntax, à la the visual format language:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"s\">\"key: value;\"</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Think of it a dictionary entry that always is followed by semicolon. It’s quite close to CSS declarations. With it, you can specify the following items:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>required : Self explanatory</li>\n  <li>allowed : Allow a subset of allowed characters</li>\n  <li>max-consecutive : Restrict the number of successive characters</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And character classes to match against those rules:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">upper</code> : A-Z</li>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">lower</code> : a-z</li>\n  <li>\n    <table>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">special</code> : -~!@#$%^&amp;*_+=`</td>\n          <td>(){}[:;”’&lt;&gt;,.? ] and space</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  </li>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">ascii-printable</code> : All ACII printable</li>\n  <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">unicode</code> : All unicode</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To further things a little, suppose you only wanted to allow the letters “j,o,r,d,a,n” because you want the strongest password that I’ll never, ever most definitely guess, then you could do this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kt\">UITextInputPasswordRules</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">descriptor</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"required: [j,o,r,d,a,n]; max-consecutive: 2; minlength: 12;\"</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Be aware that the framework has some validation against your supplied validation, resulting in some form of validationception.</p>\n\n<p>Your parameters have to <em>at least</em> use two instances of the ASCII uppercase letters, digits and ASDII lowercase letters classes. Other than that, it also must be longer than 12 characters.</p>\n\n<p>If you don’t meet this criteria, do you get some sort of runtime error or exception? Nope — the user agent just throws out your insecure, primitive suggestion and uses the default. Which is probably a good thing.</p>\n\n<p>As a bonus, you can do the same thing in HTML by using the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">passwordrules</code> attribute in your input element.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"one-time-tfa-codes\">One Time TFA Codes</h3>\n\n<p>In one of my favorite “It just works” APIs that Apple supplies to developers, it’s hard to argue that there’s something more trivial to implement in iOS development that simultaneously brings real value to users than setting a text content type.</p>\n\n<p>The powerful heuristics of iOS sucks in passwords and phone numbers, can suggest a relevant address and more. And now, that more is TFA codes, accomplished by doing nothing more than choosing <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">oneTimeCode</code>:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"n\">aTFAtextField</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">textContentType</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">oneTimeCode</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This also joins the new value, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">newPassword</code>, which would enable the password creation prompts touched on above. The usual restrictions (if you can even call them that) is that the element accepting the password must be a text field, text view or a view that adopts the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UITextInput</code> protocol.</p>\n\n<p>Of note, tvOS apps are also granted the same affordances when using the control center keyboard, the continuity keyboard or even Cupertino’s Remote App. And let’s face it, nobody wants to type on that platform so any shortcuts we can provide just promotes engagement that much more.</p>\n\n<p>Text content type is powerful, but also the definition of lightweight, simple and WYSIWYG. Sometimes what you aren’t is just as important as what you are. That’s also true with framework design.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"graphics-rendering\">Graphics Rendering</h3>\n\n<p>As we’ll briefly discuss later on, iOS 12 has automatic backing store support for views. The depth of their content drives this. So, for example, if you are rendering a grey scale image on the screen iOS will employ an 8 bit per pixel backing store instead of the usual 64 bit per pixel backing store a portrait image would incur.</p>\n\n<p>The cost savings is significant, in the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/202/\">What’s New in Cocoa Touch</a> session, Apple engineer Josh Shaffer notes that the previous example goes from 2.2 megabytes of real estate down to <em>275 kilobytes</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As aforementioned, views get this out of the box. If you draw into offscreen bitmaps using <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</code>, though, iOS won’t be able to predict the developer’s intentions with the resulting image. As such, a configurable buffer backing store style has been introduced so one can take part in the memory savings:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">rendererFormat</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRendererFormat</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">default</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>  \n<span class=\"n\">rendererFormat</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">preferredRange</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">extended</span> <span class=\"c1\">// For an extended range image</span>\n\n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">renderer</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIGraphicsImageRenderer</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">size</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">CGSize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">width</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"nv\">height</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"nv\">format</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">rendererFormat</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Above, we indicated our intention to utilize an extended range image. Though, we can also indicate that its unspecified, automatic or standard.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-small-quick-win\">The Small Quick Win</h3>\n\n<p>Detecting user interface orientations is traditionally frowned upon via Apple’s official stance. And though trait collections offer us most of what we need, it’s still refreshing to see Apple come full circle on all the edge cases with two new additions here:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">device</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIDevice</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">current</span>  \n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">isFlat</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">device</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">orientation</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isFlat</span>  \n<span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">isValid</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">device</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">orientation</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isValidInterfaceOrientation</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"darkness-for-days\">Darkness for Days</h3>\n\n<p>Also, we have dark mode on iOS, finally! Mojave doesn’t get all the fun!</p>\n\n<p>Err…shoot, no wait — we just have API support for it. But it doesn’t officially exist. But it also kinda does too, because the code is there. It’s shipped with Xcode.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know. I’m just telling you that trait collections now know about it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"nv\">darkTraitCollection</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"kt\">UITraitCollection</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">userInterfaceStyle</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">dark</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n<p>…there’s obviously enumerations for it:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-swift highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kd\">@available(iOS 12.0, *)</span> <span class=\"kd\">public</span> <span class=\"kd\">enum</span> <span class=\"kt\">UIUserInterfaceStyle</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Int</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>  \n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"n\">unspecified</span>  \n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"n\">light</span>  \n    <span class=\"k\">case</span> <span class=\"n\">dark</span>  \n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>…but they only apply to CarPlay on iOS 12 beta 1.</p>\n\n<p>So there you go 🤷🏻‍♂️.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"notifications\">Notifications</h3>\n\n<p>Technically not part of UIKit, but I did have to highlight one welcome change aside from the new grouping capabilities. Look, dealing with notifications is often a pain from a developer perspective. While not a forgone conclusion, the more notification offerings we have to support, generally the issues that could arise grow exponentially.</p>\n\n<p>You have the system notification view to toggle app permissions within iOS’ settings, possibly your own user interface to allow for granular choices, APNS to go through and oh, let’s not forget the network to contend with too.</p>\n\n<p>So, the fact that you can deep link directly into your app’s notification settings from an incoming one is not a small improvement (via <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">providesAppNotificationSettings</code>), but a very welcome change as developers continue their journey towards simplifying notification issues for them, the end user and customer support.</p>\n\n<p>🕺!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"-and-the-free-ones-\">… And The Free Ones 🙌</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1003831980025372673\">iOS 12 is fast</a>. A lot of the improvements we’ll enjoy come from deep within the framework itself. Here, I’ve chosen to highlight API changes you’ll need to put some time into to reap benefits.</p>\n\n<p>But that’s the thing — our apps will feel a bit smoother, faster and coherent without us having done anything at all.</p>\n\n<p>The reasons why range from smarter cell prefetching via the API scheduling things serially, smarter CPU diversification, more intelligent backing stores for <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">UIView</code> and Auto Layout (quite impressively) hitting O(n) instead of O(n²) for multiple common layout scenarios, to name a few.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h3>\n\n<p>Personally, I came away more impressed than I thought I would be with iOS 12. Initially, it appeared that a lot of the chatter preemptively declared that iOS 12 would be a day late and dollar short. Last year, we were treated to some marquee features within UIKit like drag and drop — so what could they throw down for us this year?</p>\n\n<p>But, as is typical, W.W.D.C. brought some new stuff we weren’t expecting, hardening updates and most importantly the new APIs. Exciting times, plus — our apps are just better by virtue of simply running on the new OS. UIKit will always be at the forefront, and this year was no exception as there’s still plenty of discussions left to be had around this year’s improvements.</p>\n\n<p>Until next time ✌️.</p>",
